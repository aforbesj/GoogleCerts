    "# Week 2 - Visualize Results\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll consider the tradeoffs involved with building a BI visualization, and you’ll practice creating charts and visualizations. You’ll also explore effective ways to organize elements within a dashboard. Finally, you’ll identify factors that contribute to processing speed and how to maximize dashboard performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to gather requirements from stakeholders to build a dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify obstacles and limitations that dashboards must overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn strategies for answering questions with the appropriate dashboard information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand a project’s scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the difference between high granularity and high detail.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Explore solutions if processing speed could be improved or made more efficient.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Identify contributing factors to processing speed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Set privacy restrictions based on what's appropriate for internal/external availability.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Translate business needs into dashboard parameters.\n",

    "So, pre-aggregation is a term\n",
    "BI professionals use to describe\n",
    "the process of performing calculations on\n",
    "the data while it's still in the database.\n",
    "This means reducing the number of\n",
    "rows or the size of the dataset\n",
    "before it's used in analysis\n",
    "or a dashboard. Think of it this way:\n",
    "if you pre-aggregate the data,\n",
    "it will be in a state that's\n",
    "closer to what you ultimately need.\n",
    "This is because some of\n",
    "the necessary calculations will\n",
    "happen before the data is aggregated\n",
    "in the database and sent to\n",
    "the data visualization tool. That's the trade-off.\n",
    "Your pipeline will involve more steps,\n",
    "but your users will get to\n",
    "the information they need more quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that pre-aggregation comes with another cost:\n",
    "pre-aggregated data is less flexible.\n",
    "Imagine that another stakeholder wants to\n",
    "represent sales data by store size.\n",
    "If you had already used\n",
    "pre-aggregation to combine the data by region\n",
    "— thereby putting all stores together, no matter their size —\n",
    "you'd have a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Project Scope | Dashboard Scope\n",
    "-----------|-------------\n",
    "Refers to the overall project goals, resources, deliverables, deadlines, collaborators, and stakeholders.| Refers to the breadth of what a dashboard is tracking, including the amount of time and how many metrics it includes.\n",
    "Determined by team leadership including project sponsors and managers.| Determined by BI teams as they consider project and user requirements.\n",
    "Outlined at the very beginning of a project to determine the overarching aspects of the project. | Outlined as part of the dashboard creation process based on the specific reporting needs.\n",
    "Involves working with key sponsors and stakeholders to better understand and align on the entire project and its goals. | Involves choosing KPIs, how much time should be represented, and how to make important data available and understandable to decision makers through the dashboard.\n",

    "Dimensions are qualitative data types that can be used to categorize data. Measures are quantitative data types that can be either discrete or continuous, and encoding is the act of translating dimensions and measures into visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensions are inherently qualitative data—this means that they are subjective and explanatory measures of a quality or characteristic. Basically, this is data that records observations about the quality of the data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Customer names\n",
    "\n",
    "    Product names\n",
    "\n",
    "    Geographic locations \n",
    "\n",
    "    Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "    Interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples are descriptive; they indicate characteristics of the data that aren’t necessarily represented by numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures, on the other hand, are quantitative. Measures are what you will use to actually count the data and track changes over time. This data can be discrete or continuous—basically, this means they can be represented by numbers with limited or unlimited values. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "    Revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "    Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "    Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have been learning, encoding is the act of translating the information represented by your dimensions and measures into visualizations. The artistic elements you choose communicate things about your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line: Lines in visualizations can be curved or straight; thick or thin; vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. They add visual form to your data and help build the structure for your visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape: Shapes are a great way to add eye-catching contrast—especially size contrast—to your data story.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Color: Color can help differentiate different elements of visualization and communicate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space: Space is the area between, around, and in objects. There should always be space in data visualizations so that the visualization isn’t too cluttered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movement: Movement is used to create a sense of flow or action in a visualization."
