    "## Communicate Insights to Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "### BI Presentation Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a BI presentation\n",
    "as anytime you communicate with\n",
    "stakeholders about their needs or project status.\n",
    "Note that this doesn't include answering questions or\n",
    "giving clarification about minor project details.\n",
    "Presentations are a bit more formal —\n",
    "even if they're in the form of an email.\n",
    "Whether your stakeholders will receive\n",
    "your project updates in their inboxes,\n",
    "on a phone call,\n",
    "at a meeting, or a mixture of these\n",
    "is something you should confirm early, when\n",
    "verifying project scope and deadlines.\n",
    "And no matter which format you're using,\n",
    "always follow presentation and\n",
    "communication best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This includes engaging your audience by\n",
    "taking the time to understand their point of view.\n",
    "Think about their stake in the project and what they hope\n",
    "to gain from the data insights that you deliver. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, be sure to\n",
    "prioritize the most relevant information.\n",
    "This means starting with high-level updates first,\n",
    "whether that's something about your current progress,\n",
    "a recent change, or your plans for next steps.\n",
    "Use clear, concise, and accessible language. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Lastly, if a stakeholder shared\n",
    "a concern with you in the previous meeting,\n",
    "it's important that your next presentation\n",
    "describes how you addressed\n",
    "that issue. And be sure to confirm\n",
    "that they're satisfied with your plan going forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip 1: Always remember audience and purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop an effective presentation that communicates your point, it’s important to keep your audience in mind. Ask yourself these two questions to help you define the overall flow and build out your presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who is my audience?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your intended audience is primarily high-level executives, your presentation should be kept at a high level. Executives tend to focus on main takeaways that encourage improving, correcting, or inventing things. Keep your presentation brief and spend most of your time on results and recommendations, or provide a walkthrough of how they can best use the tools you’ve created. It can be useful to create an executive summary slide that synthesizes the whole presentation in one slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your intended audience is comprised of stakeholders and managers, they might have more time to learn about new processes, how you developed the right tools, and ask more technical questions. Be prepared to provide more details with this audience!\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your intended audience is comprised of analysts and individual contributors, you will have the most freedom—and perhaps the most time—to go in to more detail about the data, processes, and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support all members of your audience by making your content accessible for audience members with diverse abilities, experiences, and backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the purpose of my presentation?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the goal of your presentation is to request or recommend something at the end, like a sales pitch, you can have each slide work toward the recommendations at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the goal of your presentation is to focus on the results of your analysis, each slide can help mark the path to the results. Be sure to include plenty of views of the data analysis steps to demonstrate the path you took with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the goal of your presentation is to provide a report on the data analysis, your slides should clearly summarize your data and key findings. In this case, it is alright to simply offer the data on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the goal of your presentation is to showcase how to use new business intelligence tools, your slides should clearly showcase what your audience needs to understand to start using the tool themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip 2: Prepare talking points and limit text on slides**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you create each slide in your presentation, prepare talking points (also called speaker notes) on what you will say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t forget that you will be talking at the same time that your audience is reading your slides. If your slides start becoming more like documents, you should rethink what you will say so that you can remove some text from the slides. Make it easy for your audience to skim read the slides while still paying attention to what you are saying. In general, follow the five-second rule. Your audience should not be spending more than five seconds reading any block of text on a slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip 3: End with your recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ending your presentation with recommendations and key takeaways brings the presentation to a natural close, reminds your audience of the key points, and allows them to leave with a strong impression of your recommendations. Useone slide for your recommendations at the end, and make them clear and concise. And, if you are recommending that something be done, provide next steps and describe what you would consider a successful outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip 4: Allow enough time for the presentation and questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that everyone in your audience is busy. Keep your presentation on topic and as short as possible by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Being aware of your timing. This applies to the total number of slides and the time you spend on each slide. A good starting point is to spend 1-2 minutes on summary slides and 3-5 minutes on slides that generate discussion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Presenting your data efficiently. Make sure that every slide tells a unique and important part of your data story. If a slide isn’t that unique, you might think about combining the information on that slide with another slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Saving enough time for questions at the end or allowing enough time to answer questions throughout your presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SlideShows\n",
    "\n",
    "**First slide: Agenda**\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a high-level bulleted list of the topics you will cover and the amount of time you will spend on each. Every company’s practices are different, but in general, most presentations run from 30 minutes to an hour at most. Here is an example of a 30-minute agenda:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introductions (4 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project overview and goals (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data and analysis (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommendations (3 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actionable steps (3 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Questions (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second slide: Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everyone in your audience is familiar with your project or knows why it is important. They didn’t spend the last couple of weeks thinking through the BI processes and tools for your project like you did. This slide summarizes the purpose of the project for your audience and why it is important to the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a purpose statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Service center consolidation is an important cost savings initiative. The aim of this project is to monitor the impact of service center consolidation on customer response times for continued improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Third slide: Data/analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing the data, the BI processes and tools, and how your audience can use them, be sure to include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slides typically have a logical order (beginning, middle, and end) to fully build the story. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each slide should logically introduce the slide that follows it. Visual cues from the slides or verbal cues from your talking points should let the audience know when you will go on to the next slide. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember not to use too much text on the slides. When in doubt, refer back to the second tip on preparing talking points and limiting the text on slides. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The high-level information that people read from the slides shouldn’t be the same as the information you provide in your talking points. There should be a nice balance between the two to tell a good story. You don’t want to simply read or say the words on the slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "For extra visuals on the slides, use animations. For example, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fade in one bullet point at a time as you discuss each on a slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only display the visual that is relevant to what you are talking about (fade out non-relevant visuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use arrows or callouts to point to a specific area of a visual that you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fourth slide: Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been telling your story well in the previous slides, the recommendations will be obvious to your audience. This is when you might get a lot of questions about how your data supports your recommendations. Be ready to communicate how your data backs up your conclusion or recommendations in different ways. Having multiple words to state the same thing also helps if someone is having difficulty with one particular explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fifth slide: Call to action**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the call to action can be combined with the recommendations slide. If there are multiple actions or activities recommended, a separate slide is best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our example of a purpose statement: Service center consolidation is an important cost savings initiative. The aim of this project is to monitor the impact of service center consolidation on customer response times for continued improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the monitoring reports showed that service center consolidation negatively impacted customer response times. A call to action might be to examine if processes need to change to bring customer response times back to what they were before the consolidation."

    "### Making a Presentation for BI Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect image samples from Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create Intro Slide\n",
    "\n",
    "The first slide you’ll include in your presentation is an intro slide. You’ll want to include a brief title for the project and your name and/or your company’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your intro slide should be very simple and include only the bare minimum information for your audience to understand your project’s topic. You can include aesthetic elements, such as borders, graphics, and colors, as long as they match the visuals or subject matter of the rest of your presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In at least one slide, describe or summarize the business problem that your BI visualization addresses. Your slides should feature only a few bullet points or visuals, and should not be too wordy. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Describe methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In at least one slide, describe how you processed and/or visualized the data. You can describe how you built your pipeline, which metrics you focused on, the types of charts you chose, and any other notable steps involved in your BI project process. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Summarize Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "In at least one slide, summarize some insights from your visualization. This might include general trends, significant differences from project expectations, or recommendations about what your client’s project should do in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should include 1–3 high-level insights or trends. Ideally, the insights are direct answers to the business questions you answered. If your stakeholder wants to know the busiest holiday for traffic, then you can share the chart that includes that answer."

    "### Predictive Analysis for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analytics is a branch of data analytics that uses historical data to identify patterns to forecast future outcomes that can guide decision-making. The goal of predictive analytics is to anticipate upcoming events and preemptively make decisions according to those predictions. The predictions can focus on any point in the future—from weekly measurements to revenue predictions for the next year. \n",
    "\n",
    "By feeding historical data into a predictive model, stakeholders can make decisions that aren’t just based on what has already happened in the past—they can make decisions that take into account likely future events, too! \n",
    "\n",
    "One example would be a hotel using predictive analytics to determine staffing needs for major holidays. In the hospitality industry, there are many variables that might affect staffing decisions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the number of guests\n",
    "\n",
    "- what services they’re using the most\n",
    "\n",
    "- how much it costs to pay employees to be there\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portfolio and Resume\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever job posting you're looking at, if they have keywords for skills required,\n",
    "make sure that you have those words listed on your resume as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong analytical skills\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pattern recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relational databases and SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong data visualization skills\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proficiency with spreadsheets, SQL, DataFlow, and Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting Out\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you work on your resume, it might help to browse current job openings on job search sites. You might not be ready to begin applying, but if you know more about the job market, you can create a more effective resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, go to the job search site of your choice. Start with a simple Google search for “entry-level business intelligence jobs.” Or search on a specific site, such as LinkedIn®, Indeed, or Glassdoor. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might also try specific search queries such as “medical business intelligence analyst” or “financial business intelligence analyst” to get job listings related to a field of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you receive your search results, pay attention to the skills and requirements for the listings. This will give you an idea of which high-demand skills to emphasize in your resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update Info\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check that your contact information is up to date. Your contact information should include your name, location (such as city and state), phone number, and an email address that is easy to read, relatively short, and avoids too many words or symbols that are unrelated to your name. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have a LinkedIn® profile, add a link to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a link to your portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If necessary, update your job title with a title that conveys both your current experience and the role you are seeking, such as Business Intelligence Professional or Business Intelligence Analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Proofread\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your resume should include the following components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Personal information: Your name, location, phone number, email address, and links to your LinkedIn® profile (if you have one) and portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "- Education: A list of any school you attended after high school in reverse chronological order. Each listing should include the school’s location; the degree, diploma, or certificate you earned; and the dates that you attended. It should also include internships, apprenticeships, and any professional certifications or credentials you hold, including the Google Business Intelligence Certificate and the Google Data Analytics Certificate (if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experience: A list of at least three of your past positions in reverse chronological order. Each listing should include the company name, the location, your job title, the dates you worked there, and a description of your responsibilities. Your descriptions should be tailored to the job description of the position you are seeking, emphasizing BI-related and transferable skills. Your experience section should also use Problem-Action-Result (PAR) statements to describe your relevant accomplishments and measurable impact in your previous roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Skills: A list of the skills you have that are most relevant to the position, including skills you’ve learned in this program, skills you’ve gained in previous education or positions, and your strengths and competencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Your resume should also be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Free of spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- As concise as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "- No more than 1–2 pages in length\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interview Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find connections between the job listing and your resume: First, re-read your resume and the job description to help you draw lines between the two. Where do they connect? Then, as you interview, include specific keywords or phrases from the job description that match skills you possess or achievements you have accomplished previously in your career.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on data: As you start to think about things you want to highlight in your interview, don’t forget to include data. This helps your interviewer understand not just your overall achievements, but how big of an impact you made. What data can you provide that tells the story of your experience in terms of the needs of this position? The “equation” we suggest includes something like this: I accomplished X as measured by Y doing Z. Here’s an example: “I increased customer satisfaction by 22% in three months by designing a new digital onboarding process.” If you don’t have access to this kind of data from a previous position, you can still indicate the scope you were accountable for and strengthen the language you use when describing your responsibilities by including action words like provided, created, developed, supported, implemented, and generated. For example: “I implemented a new meeting-scheduling system that saved employees time and improved morale.” \n",
    "\n",
    "- Look back at past work experiences: Review your work history. That may not sound like something you need to prepare for, but most of us have done more than we think and it’s easy to forget some of our own wins (and lessons learned from mistakes). Think of examples of times you achieved something so you are prepared to answer questions like “Tell me about a time when...” or “How would you approach this situation...?\" People often diminish or ignore their past job experiences if they don’t immediately apply to the position they’re applying for. However, you bring a lot of transferable skills from past jobs that might be useful—you just have to frame them the right way. For example, you might have gained communication skills from a previous position that can help you connect with stakeholders in a BI role.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Come ready with questions: Next, come to the interview with your own questions, such as “What are some upcoming projects I’d be working on? What current goals is the company focused on? Can you tell me about the team I’ll be working with?” This shows you care about understanding the company and the position you’re applying for. Besides, this is your opportunity to interview them as well.\n",
