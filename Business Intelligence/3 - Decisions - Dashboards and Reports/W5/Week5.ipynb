    "# Week 5 - C3 EoC Project\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll finish working on your portfolio project by building a BI dashboard. You’ll refer to key BI documents to create a low-fidelity mockup, design charts, and organize your dashboard. Your portfolio artifacts will include a mockup and a working dashboard, which will be ready to present to stakeholders.\n",
    "Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Present a end-to-end business intelligence case study through a complete portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply knowledge of business intelligence, data pipelines, and dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a dashboard in Tableau\n",

    "## Cyclistic Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "*Background:*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this fictitious workplace scenario, the imaginary company Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel among stations at these locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a business plan for next year. They want to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.  Previously, you gathered information from your meeting notes to complete important project planning documents and generated useful target tables. Now you are ready for the next part of your project!\n",
    "Course 3 challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use project planning documents to identify key metrics and dashboard requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upload target tables into Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design charts and tables to share insights with stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an effective dashboard using those charts and tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "The product development team at Cyclistic has begun developing their business plan for next year. In order to build a better Cyclistic, the team needs to understand how customers are currently using the bikes, how location and other factors impact demand, and what stations get the most traffic. The Cyclistic team has a few goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what customers want, what makes a successful product, and how new stations might alleviate demand in different geographical areas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how the current line of bikes are used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply customer usage insights to inform new station growth\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how different users (subscribers and non-subscribers) use the bikes\n"
