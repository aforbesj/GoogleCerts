    "## Get Started with Data Vizualizations and Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dashboards and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example: say a BI Professional at an airline designed a dashboard for\n",
    "stakeholders who want to monitor new airplane demand over the next 10 years.\n",
    "They include six different chart types, so\n",
    "the users can easily identify important metrics and KPIs related to consumers'\n",
    "travel frequency, the useful product life cycle of airplanes, demand for\n",
    "new crafts, and lots more.\n",
    "But perhaps something in the industry changes.\n",
    "The stakeholders might ask for new KPIs,\n",
    "different arrangements of visual elements, or similar updates.\n",
    "It's the BI professional's job to interpret their requests,\n",
    "determine if they're reasonable and feasible, and implement them into the dash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your role as a BI professional will rarely\n",
    "involve interpreting the data\n",
    "that your dashboard displays,\n",
    "instead, you'll create a dash that\n",
    "empowers users to interpret the data on their own.\n",
    "You'll determine what the dashboard needs to do,\n",
    "build the appropriate tool,\n",
    "and maintain and improve on it over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, BI professionals will tailor a dashboard for a specific purpose. The three most common categories are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strategic: focuses on long-term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operational: tracks short-term performance and intermediate goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analytical: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets\n",
    "\n",
    "*Strategic dashboards*\n",
    "\n",
    "A wide range of businesses use strategic dashboards when evaluating and aligning their strategic goals. These dashboards provide information over the longest time frame—from a single financial quarter to years. They typically contain information that is useful for enterprise-wide decision-making. For example, a strategic dashboard could focus on key performance indicators over a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operational dashboards*\n",
    "\n",
    "Operational dashboards are arguably the most common type of dashboard. Because these dashboards contain information on a time scale of days, weeks, or months, they can provide performance insight almost in real-time. This enables businesses to track and maintain their immediate operational processes in light of their strategic goals. An operational dashboard could focus on customer service team performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Analytic dashboards*\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytic dashboards contain the details involved in the use, analysis, and predictions made by data scientists. Data science teams usually create and maintain the most technical category, analytic dashboards. An example of an analytic dashboard could focus on metrics for a company’s financial performance."

    "## Produce a Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Mockups\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a BI professional works with their stakeholders to figure out what\n",
    "needs to be included in the dash.\n",
    "The process usually begins with a stakeholder describing their needs.\n",
    "For example, a sales or\n",
    "marketing executive may want a dashboard that tracks customer spending habits.\n",
    "They could ask for visualizations that demonstrate how often customers\n",
    "buy the same product again, or how much revenue increases at peak shopping times,\n",
    "such as during certain holidays. \n",
    "\n",
    "After stakeholders explain their needs,\n",
    "a BI professional follows up with their own questions.\n",
    "This helps determine the level of detail involved.\n",
    "Some questions I like to ask are: What's the dashboard supposed to do?\n",
    "And what KPIs and dimensions is it tracking?\n",
    "It's helpful to also ask who the dashboard is being built for.\n",
    "Is it someone who needs the most specific level of detail or\n",
    "someone who just needs high-level insights? \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the dashboard iteration process is to create a low-fidelity\n",
    "mockup.\n",
    "A low-fidelity mockup is a simple draft of a visualization that is used for\n",
    "planning a dashboard and evaluating its progress.\n",
    "It may be a pen-and-paper model of how it's organized, or\n",
    "a dashboard with a very limited amount of data.\n",
    "The stakeholder provides feedback, which you act on.\n",
    "Sharing a low-fidelity mockup is an excellent way to include your stakeholders\n",
    "and make the most of your collaboration.\n",
    "Also, it's very effective at avoiding potential errors.\n",
    "If you make an assumption that turns out to be incorrect, the mockup can help\n",
    "you and your users identify it and implement the necessary fixes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mockups focus on the arrangement of objects and the contents of each object. An example of the level of detail it should include is “This big chart will go on the top of the main page. It will be a bar chart that represents the frequency of patient visits. Next to it will be this chart, which answers the question about the time between each visit.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mockups can include annotations, but they should feature minimal text overall. The majority of your details should go in your planning docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity’s scenario, your contact at the private practice wants to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    What is the frequency of visits from returning patients?\n",
    "\n",
    "    What is the average length of time between visits per patient and/or diagnosis?\n",
    "\n",
    "    How many patients are being treated for a specific condition? How does their visit frequency differ from patients who only need general visits?\n",
    "\n",
    "    What are the results of the five-question surveys that patients are asked to complete after each visit?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mockup example, the following section of the dashboard includes interactive filters that stakeholders can use to view data at various timescales. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next section includes key metrics that interest the stakeholder, such as the number of total patients, the average wait time between visits, and the available staff during that period of time. These metrics include arrows that indicate whether the metric has risen or fallen since the previous time period. It also includes a chart that compares the number of new and returning visits over time, the average time between visits for general patients and specific diagnoses, and the number of patients visiting each medical specialty. These three charts answer the first three business questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section features features a pie chart that demonstrates the results of the five-question patient survey. It also lists the percentage of respondents who selected each answer for each question. This section answers the final question in the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mis-steps\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of dashboard issues that BI professionals encounter.\n",
    "Put simply, they are data problems, tool problems, and audience problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "A data problem is an issue caused by the data being used that's in the dashboard.\n",
    "Maybe you've included more data than you need just as you've discovered with\n",
    "pipelines.\n",
    "This can cause dashboards to run slowly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding data\n",
    "problems requires you to be very specific before you begin building any BI tool.\n",
    "Some key points to consider include making sure you know what data should be\n",
    "displayed and where that data should come from.\n",
    "Also set up a plan for how you will access the data and\n",
    "import it into your dashboard. And confirm that you have permission to\n",
    "access the data and you know what file type you'll use. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tool Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are dashboard issues involving the hardware or software being used.\n",
    "The most basic type of tool\n",
    "problem is simply selecting the wrong tool.\n",
    "As you know, each company uses particular coding languages and\n",
    "data visualization programs. And\n",
    "in most cases, the BI professional must use their organization's preferred tools.\n",
    "As you've been learning, many of the skills you apply to one tool easily transfers to\n",
    "another. But you still need to understand how these tools are different so\n",
    "you can navigate them effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programs or\n",
    "servers may become overwhelmed if they're tracking too many KPIs. Sometimes,\n",
    "they can even crash if too many people are making edits to the same visualization.\n",
    "If you run into a hardware limitation during your building phase,\n",
    "you may need to reduce the project scope or find a more creative solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Audience Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "These are dashboard issues caused by failing to adequately consider the needs\n",
    "of the user.\n",
    "For instance, imagine you're tasked with creating a dashboard for\n",
    "a company's human resources team.\n",
    "The tool needs to keep track of how many employees the company has hired, or\n",
    "will hire, and how many have resigned.\n",
    "If your dashboard also includes financial and operational metrics, these won't be\n",
    "relevant to your audience and may clutter the dash causing complexity or confusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
