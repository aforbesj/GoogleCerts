    "## Database Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data marts and lakes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these tools is a data mart, as you may recall a data mart is a subject\n",
    "oriented database that can be a subset of a larger data warehouse.\n",
    "NBI, subject oriented, describes something that is associated with specific areas or\n",
    "departments of a business such as finance, sales or marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A data lake is a database system that stores large amounts of raw data\n",
    "in its original format until it's needed.\n",
    "This makes the data easily accessible,\n",
    "because it doesn't require a lot of processing.\n",
    "Like a data warehouse, a data lake combines many different sources, but\n",
    "data warehouses are hierarchical with files and folders to organize the data.\n",
    "Whereas data lakes are flat and while data has been tagged so it is identifiable,\n",
    "it's not organized, it's fluid, which is why it's called a data lake\n",
    "\n",
    "ELT takes the same steps but reorganizes them so\n",
    "that the pipeline Extracts, Loads and then Transforms the data.\n",
    "Basically ELT is a type of data pipeline that enables data to be gathered from\n",
    "different sources.\n",
    "Usually data lakes, then loaded into a unified destination system and\n",
    "transformed into a useful format.\n",
    "ELT enables BI professionals to ingest so many different kinds of data into\n",
    "a storage system as soon as that data is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ETL vs ELT\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences | ETL | ELT\n",
    "------|-----|-----\n",
    "The order of extraction, transformation, and loading data | Data is extracted, transformed in a staging area, and loaded into the target system | Data is extracted, loaded into the target system, and transformed as needed for analysis\n",
    "Location of transformations | Data is moved to a staging area where it is transformed before delivery | Data is transformed in the destination system, so no staging area is required\n",
    "Age of the technology | ETL has been used for over 20 years, and many tools have been developed to support ETL pipeline systems| ELT is a newer technology with fewer support tools built-in to existing technology\n",
    "Access to data within the system | ETL systems only transform and load the data designated when the warehouse and pipeline are constructed | ELT systems load all of the data, allowing users to choose which data to analyze at any time\n",
    "Calculations| Calculations executed in an ETL system replace or revise existing columns in order to push the results to the target table | Calculations are added directly to the existing dataset\n",
    "Compatible storage systems | ETL systems are typically integrated with structured, relational data warehouses| ELT systems can ingest unstructured data from sources like data lakes\n",
    "Security and compliance| Sensitive information can be redacted or anonymized before loading it into the data warehouse, which protects data| Data has to be uploaded before data can be anonymized, making it more vulnerable\n",
    "Data size| ETL is great for dealing with smaller datasets that need to undergo complex transformations| ELT is well-suited to systems using large amounts of both structured and unstructured data\n",
    "Wait times| ETL systems have longer load times, but analysis is faster because data has already been transformed when users access it|Data loading is very fast in ELT systems because data can be ingested without waiting for transformations to occur, but analysis is slower\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Storage System\n",
    "Data Warehouse | Data Lake\n",
    "------|-----\n",
    "Data has already been processed and stored in a relational system| Data is raw and unprocessed until it is needed for analysis; additionally, it can have a copy of the entire OLTP or relational database\n",
    "The data’s purpose has already been assigned, and the data is currently in use|The data’s purpose has not been determined yet\n",
    "Making changes to the system can be complicated and require a lot of work|Systems are highly accessible and easy to update\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "Database performance is a measure of\n",
    "the workload that can be processed by a database,\n",
    "as well as the associated costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Workload\n",
    "\n",
    "In BI, workload refers to\n",
    "the combination of transactions, queries,\n",
    "analysis, and system commands being\n",
    "processed by the database system at any given time.\n",
    "It's common for a database's workload to\n",
    "fluctuate drastically from day to day,\n",
    "depending on what jobs are being processed\n",
    "and how many users are interacting with the database.\n",
    "The good news is that you can\n",
    "often predict these fluctuations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughput is the overall capability of\n",
    "the database's hardware and software to process requests.\n",
    "Throughput is made up of the input and output speed,\n",
    "the central processor unit speed,\n",
    "how well the machine can run parallel processes,\n",
    "the database management system,\n",
    "and the operating system and system software.\n",
    "Basically, throughput describes\n",
    "a workload size that the system can handle. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes the disk space and memory.\n",
    "Resources are a big part of\n",
    "a database system's ability to\n",
    "process requests and handle data.\n",
    "They can also fluctuate,\n",
    "especially if the hardware or\n",
    "other dedicated resources are\n",
    "shared with additional databases,\n",
    "software applications, or services.\n",
    "Also, cloud-based systems are\n",
    "particularly prone to fluctuation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization involves\n",
    "maximizing the speed and efficiency with\n",
    "which data is retrieved in order to\n",
    "ensure high levels of database performance.\n",
    "This is one of the most important factors that\n",
    "BI Professionals return to again and again.\n",
    "Coming up soon, we're going to\n",
    "talk about it in more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Contention \n",
    "\n",
    "Contention occurs when two or more components\n",
    "attempt to use a single resource in a conflicting way.\n",
    "This can really slow things down.\n",
    "For instance, if there are\n",
    "multiple processes trying to\n",
    "update the same piece of data,\n",
    "those processes are in contention.\n",
    "As contention increases,\n",
    "the throughput of the database decreases.\n",
    "Limiting contention as much as possible will help\n",
    "ensure the database is performing at its best. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Make efficent queries, a query plan is a description of the steps\n",
    "the database system takes in order to execute a query. The query plan is the how.\n",
    "If queries are running slowly,\n",
    "checking the query plan to find out if there are steps\n",
    "causing more draw than necessary can be helpful.\n",
    "This is another iterative process.\n",
    "After checking the query plan,\n",
    "you might rewrite the query or create\n",
    "new tables and then check the query plan again. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An index is an organizational tag\n",
    "used to quickly locate data within a database system.\n",
    "If the tables within a database\n",
    "haven't been fully indexed,\n",
    "it can take the database longer to locate resources.\n",
    "In Cloud-based systems working with big data,\n",
    "you might have data partitions instead of indexes.\n",
    "Data partitioning is the process\n",
    "of dividing a database into\n",
    "distinct logical parts in order to\n",
    "improve query processing and increase manageability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next issue is fragmented data.\n",
    "Fragmented data occurs when data is\n",
    "broken up into many pieces that are not stored together.\n",
    "Often as a result of using\n",
    "the data frequently or creating,\n",
    "deleting, or modifying files.\n",
    "For example, if you are accessing the same data\n",
    "often and versions of it are being saved in your cache,\n",
    "those versions are actually\n",
    "causing fragmentation in your system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing queries will make your pipeline operations faster and more efficient. In your role as a BI professional, you might work on projects with extremely large datasets. For these projects, it’s important to write SQL queries that are as fast and efficient as possible. Otherwise, your data pipelines might be slow and difficult to work with.\n",
