    "# Week 3\n",
    "## Constant Change and Other Limitations\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Contexts helps eliminate the risk of misinterpretation,\n",
    "this saves your stakeholders time and ensures they have\n",
    "accurate information to make\n",
    "data-driven business decisions.\n",
    "As you likely know,\n",
    "in data analytics,\n",
    "context turns raw data into meaningful information.\n",
    "When you contextualize,\n",
    "you put something into perspective,\n",
    "this involves considering its origin\n",
    "and other relevant background information,\n",
    "the motivation behind it,\n",
    "the larger setting in which it exists\n",
    "such as a particular time period,\n",
    "and what it might have an impact on.\n",
    "Contextualization gives something greater\n",
    "meaning to help people understand it more completely.\n",
    "This also supports fairness\n",
    "and reduces the chance of bias when\n",
    "your users seek to gain\n",
    "useful insights from the data you're presenting,\n",
    "which brings me to context in a BI setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "In BI, there's another aspect\n",
    "of context that professionals care about\n",
    "a lot and that's\n",
    "contextualizing the tools we create for our users. \n",
    "Dashboards are common for contextualizing and doing this. It is also important\n",
    "to note who will be reading the dashboard as they may have different expectations between them.\n",
    "What 5% growth in proccessing speed is to a developer, is different to a sales rep or executive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, to make an effective dashboard,\n",
    "it's necessary to first understand how\n",
    "each particular stakeholder will actually use it.\n",
    "By taking the time to think this through,\n",
    "you ensure that you create\n",
    "one robust dashboard rather\n",
    "than many less effective ones.\n",
    "Also, because you've created\n",
    "a single accessible shared dashboard,\n",
    "this allows for some great collaboration among users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Context is the who, what, where, when, and why surrounding data that makes it meaningful. Knowing this background information helps us interpret data correctly and visualize useful business intelligence insights for stakeholders. When BI professionals understand the context, choose the right data, and build contextualized visuals to share with stakeholders, they can empower businesses and leadership to make successful decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Availability and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Data availability describes the degree or extent to which\n",
    "timely and relevant information is readily\n",
    "accessible and able to be put to use.\n",
    "Unfortunately, there are various factors that can affect\n",
    "data availability and therefore can\n",
    "compromise the integrity of BI solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical issues related to\n",
    "data integrity include duplicates,\n",
    "missing information, inconsistent structure,\n",
    "or not conforming to business rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visibility is a degree or\n",
    "extent to which information can be identified,\n",
    "monitored, and integrated from\n",
    "disparate internal and external sources.\n",
    "For instance, employees working in\n",
    "a company's operations department might have\n",
    "no idea what data is stored\n",
    "in the communications department.\n",
    "Or someone working in the logistics unit might\n",
    "have data files that contain lots of great information,\n",
    "but no one else even knows they exist.\n",
    "Now on the other hand, when you do\n",
    "have clear data visibility,\n",
    "it's possible to achieve accurate and timely insights and\n",
    "really improve your organization's\n",
    "responsiveness and agility. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Update Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, BI projects\n",
    "will involve multiple data sources.\n",
    "It's very common for\n",
    "disparate sources to refresh at different times,\n",
    "such as weekly versus monthly.\n",
    "Let's say a business intelligence professional works\n",
    "for a pet supply manufacturer\n",
    "based in Brazil and maybe\n",
    "they analyze products sales volume by city.\n",
    "If a retail partner moves from\n",
    "Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo in the middle of July,\n",
    "all of that month's sales would fall under Rio simply\n",
    "because the partner's address hasn't\n",
    "been updated yet in the BI system.\n",
    "Either the retailer's data\n",
    "needs to refresh sooner to match\n",
    "sales data or the manufacturer\n",
    "should look at all data on a monthly basis.\n",
    "This is why it's important for\n",
    "the BI professional to understand how\n",
    "the update frequency of\n",
    "different data sources can affect insights.\n",
    "Even if individual data sources are perfect,\n",
    "the integration aspect is often pretty messy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Data availability may be affected because of a change to\n",
    "internal procedures such as\n",
    "a system update or a new record-keeping process.\n",
    "It may change externally because of\n",
    "a user interface upgrade or\n",
    "an adjustment to a particular algorithm.\n",
    "To address this issue,\n",
    "BI professionals must have a plan for how they will keep\n",
    "stakeholders up-to-date on changes\n",
    "that might affect the project.\n",
    "They should encourage team members to think about\n",
    "what tools or methods they're using now,\n",
    "what could change,\n",
    "and how it may influence the data being\n",
    "tracked and how to fill any potential gaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Issues with Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have incomplete or nonexistent data, you might not have enough data to reach a conclusion. Or, you might even be exploring data about a totally different business problem! Understanding what data is available, identifying potential other sources, and filling in the gaps is an important part of the BI process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Misaligned data\n",
    "\n",
    "As a BI professional, you will often use data from different sources. Some of these might be internal sources to the business you’re working with, but they might also include external sources. These sources might define and measure things in completely different ways. In cases like these, establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy. This will make sure comparisons between sources are meaningful and insightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirty data\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirty data refers to data that contains errors. Dirty data can cause errors in your system, inaccurate reports, and poor decision-making. Implementing processes for cleaning data by fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset is one way you can prepare for this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data privacy means preserving a data subject’s information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. This is also called information privacy or data protection. Data privacy is concerned with the access, use, and collection of personal data. For the people whose data is being collected, this means they have the right to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Protection from unauthorized access to their private data\n",
    "\n",
    "    Freedom from inappropriate use of their data\n",

    "    The right to inspect, update, or correct their data\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ability to give consent to data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "    Legal right to access the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.\n",

    "## Moving Beyond Data Limitations\n",
    "### Meaningful Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanity metrics are data points that are\n",
    "intended to impress others but are not\n",
    "indicative of actual performance and\n",
    "therefore cannot reveal any meaningful business insights.\n",
    "A well-known vanity metric is\n",
    "the number of people following a company on social media.\n",
    "Maybe there are hundreds of thousands of followers\n",
    "but how many of them are actually making a purchase,\n",
    "how many of them refer other customers to the site,\n",
    "and how much revenue do they\n",
    "actually generate for the business?\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining which metrics to include on a dashboard,\n",
    "BI professionals consider four key things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of metrics: More information is not always better. BI professionals limit the number of metrics on dashboards to focus specifically on the ones that are key to a project’s success. Key metrics are relevant and actionable. For instance, if metric X drops, is this good or bad? What action would a user take if it dropped that would be different if it rose instead? Too many metrics that aren’t relevant to the project can be confusing and make your dashboard less effective. The goal isn’t to overload the dashboard to account for every single use case, but 80% of the common use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alignment with business objectives: Understanding the business objectives can help you narrow down which metrics will support those goals and measure their success. For example, if the business objective is to increase sales, include revenue in your dashboard. You will most likely not want to include a metric such as customer satisfaction because that is not directly related to the business objective of increasing sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The necessary technologies and processes: It’s important to confirm that the necessary technologies and processes are in place for the metrics you’re choosing. If you can’t obtain and analyze the necessary data, then those metrics aren’t going to be very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The cadence of data: You have to consider how frequently the data becomes available. If a lot of metrics are delivered at a different cadence and frequency, it becomes difficult to schedule a review.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use SMART methodology: If you earned your Google Data Analytics Certificate, you know the SMART methodology is a useful tool for creating effective questions to ask stakeholders. It can also be used to identify and refine key metrics by ensuring that they are specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. This can help you avoid vague or super-high-level metrics that aren’t useful to stakeholders, and instead create metrics that are precise and informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### North-Star Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "North Star Metrics are the core measurable value of products or services over an entire business lifetime. They guide the business forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cross-team alignment: Different teams have different specialties and focuses that help a business function. They aren’t always working on the same projects or with the same metrics, which can make it difficult to align across the entire business. A north star metric allows all of the teams to have a consistent goal to focus on, even as they work on different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tracking growth: It can be difficult to understand and track the growth of an entire organization over time without understanding the driving metrics that determine growth. A north star metric provides a long-term measurable data point that stakeholders can focus on when discussing overall performance and growth in a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Focusing values: A north star metric is primarily a guiding principle for a business– it determines what is important to the organization and stakeholders. This means that choosing the right metric to guide a business can help keep the values in check– whether that’s customer satisfaction, number of customers completing the sales cycle, or customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to choose a metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is essential to this business’s processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the most important KPIs being measured?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out of those KPIs, what captures all of the necessary information about this business?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can the other metrics be structured around that primary metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because more businesses have begun using north star metrics to guide their business strategies, there are a lot of examples of north star metrics in different industries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- E-commerce:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Weekly number of customers completing the sales cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Value of daily purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Social media:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Number of daily active users\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Messages sent per day\n",
    "\n",
    "- Streaming and media services:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Number of new sign-ups\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Total reading time\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Total watching time\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Monthly subscription revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hospitality:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Number of nights booked\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Number of repeat customers\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples– there are a lot of potential north star metrics for businesses to choose from across a variety of industries, from tech to finance!\n",
    "\n",
