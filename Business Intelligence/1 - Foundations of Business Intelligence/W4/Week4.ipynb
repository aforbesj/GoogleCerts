    "### Experiential Learning\n",
    "Experiential learning, whether for a hobby or for work,\n",
    "is always an awesome opportunity.\n",
    "It gives you a broader view of the world,\n",
    "provides important insight\n",
    "into your particular interests and passions,\n",
    "and helps build self-confidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you begin working,\n",
    "you'll consider the knowledge and skills\n",
    "you've acquired in this course\n",
    "and how they can be applied to your project.\n",
    "I encourage you to keep some notes\n",
    "about your approach,\n",
    "methods, systems, and accomplishments.\n",
    "This will help you identify\n",
    "important points to share with a hiring manager,\n",
    "such as the many transferable skills you've gained.\n",
    "A transferable skill is a capability or proficiency\n",
    "that can be applied from one job to another.\n",
    "Highlighting your transferable skills\n",
    "is especially important when changing jobs or industries.\n",
    "For instance, if you learned\n",
    "how to solve customer complaints\n",
    "while working as a host at a restaurant,\n",
    "you could highlight\n",
    "the transferable skill of problem-solving\n",
    "when applying for a job in the BI field. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What a BI Manager Looks For in an Applicant\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidates including Portfolios in their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "They like presentations of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### End of Course Project Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the technical and organizational skills needed to complete end-of-course projects, you will need to practice effective communication skills. To prepare you, each project will require you to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather information about the business problem to be solved or question to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete key BI documents, including the Stakeholder Requirements, Project Requirements, and Strategy documents\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define team members\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand time and budget requirements\n",
    "\n",

    "- Know how to measure success\n",
    "\n",
    "- Highlight your transferable skills\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Course 1 end-of-course project you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review relevant project material from stakeholders to identify key requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop project requirement documents to align with stakeholder needs and guide project planning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "The end-of-course projects enable you to apply your new BI skills and knowledge, demonstrate fundamental BI skills to prospective employers, and showcase what you have learned from the Google Business Intelligence Certificate. Having a portfolio to share during job interviews is a proven way to become a competitive BI candidate. Plus, you are investing lots of time and effort in the program, so completing this project will be a grand celebration of your learning achievements!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executive Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Business intelligence professionals need ways to share and communicate plans, updates, and summaries about projects. A common document called an executive summary is used to update decision makers who may not be directly involved in the tasks of a project. In your role as a BI professional, you will often be involved in creating executive summaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, an executive summary can be a useful way to describe your end-of-course project to potential employers. This document can give interviewers exploring your portfolio an easy-to-understand explanation of your projects and be a useful way to reference your projects during the actual interview. \n",
    "\n",
    "The provided sample executive summary deals with an imagined wildfire predictability project. The intended audience of this summary is a group of decision makers from many different departments within teams that service a variety of parks. The purpose of this summary is to share the insights gained through data analysis of wildfires in the US. Each section delivers a short statement without embellishment. This allows decision makers who are often short on time the ability to quickly grasp the most relevant points about a project. Reference this document as you review each of the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project title: \n",
    "\n",
    "A project's theme is incorporated into the executive summary title to create an immediate connection with the target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "A statement that focuses on the need or concern being targeted or addressed by the project. Note, also, that the problem can also be referred to as the hypothesis that you’re trying to prove through analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "This statement summarizes a project’s main goal. In this section, actions are described that are intended to address the concerns outlined in the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Details/Key insights: \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is to provide any additional background and information that may assist the target audience in understanding the project's objectives. Determining what details to include depends heavily on the intended audience. It may also be the case that you choose to include some project reflections. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course 1 Project Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Course 1, Foundations of Business intelligence, you explored the world of BI professionals and learned how BI contributes to an organization's vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Course 1 skills:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice effective communication\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand cross-functional team dynamics\n",

    "## Cyclistic Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "*Background:*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this fictitious workplace scenario, the imaginary company Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel among stations at these locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Scenario:*\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a newly hired BI professional at Cyclistic. The company’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. They want to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Course 1 challenge:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather information from notes taken at the last Cyclistic executive meeting \n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify relevant stakeholders for each task\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organize tasks into milestones\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete project planning documents in order to align with stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The story, as well as all names, characters, and incidents portrayed, are fictitious. No identification with actual people (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. The data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclistic’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclistic has captured data points for every trip taken by their customers, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trip start time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trip end time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rented bike’s identification number\n",
    "\n",
    "- The type of customer (either a one-time customer, or a subscriber)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes millions of rides, so the team wants a dashboard that summarizes key insights. Business plans that are driven by customer insights are more successful than plans driven by just internal staff observations. The executive summary must include key data points that are summarized and aggregated in order for the leadership team to get a clear vision of how customers are using Cyclistic.\n",

    "\n",
    "Project approvals and dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets will include customer (user) data, which Jamal will need to approve. Also the project might need approval by the teams that own specific product data, including bike trip duration and bike identification numbers. So I need to make sure that stakeholders have data access to all datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project goal: Grow Cyclistic’s Customer Base**\n",
    "\n",
    "Details from Ms. Romero:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what customers want, what makes a successful product, and how new stations might alleviate demand in different geographical areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how the current line of bikes are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can we apply customer usage insights to inform new station growth?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The customer growth wants to understand how different users (subscribers and non-subscribers) use our bikes. We’ll want to investigate a large group of users to get a fair representation of users across locations and with low- to high-activity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep in mind users might use Cyclistic less when the weather is inclement. This should be visible in the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deliverables and metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A table or map visualization exploring starting and ending station locations, aggregated by location. I can use any location identifier, such as station, zip code, neighborhood, and/or borough. This should show the number of trips at starting locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Tip: You can show either a table or a map. For more about creating maps in Tableau, check out the  Build a simple map guide on Tableau Help \n",
    "\n",
    "  - . For a table, you could include just starting locations or a combination of starting and ending locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A visualization showing which destination (ending) locations are popular based on the total trip minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Tip: Focus on peak months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A visualization that focuses on trends from the summer of 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A visualization showing the percent growth in the number of trips year over year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather insights about congestion at stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Tip: For each day, use a table calculation to calculate the net of start and ending trips per station. This gives an approximation of whether there are more bikes coming in or out of a station.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather insights about the number of trips across all starting and ending locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather insights about peak usage by time of day, season, and the impact of weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dashboard must be created in 6 weeks!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure success:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze data that spans at least one year to see how seasonality affects usage. Exploring data that spans multiple months will capture peaks and valleys in usage. Evaluate each trip on the number of rides per starting location and per day/month/year to understand trends. For example, do customers use Cyclistic less when it rains? Or does bikeshare demand stay consistent? Does this vary by location and user types (subscribers vs. nonsubscribers)? Use these outcomes to find out more about what impacts customer demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes latitude and longitude of stations but does not identify more geographic aggregation details, such as zip code, neighborhood name, or borough. The team will provide a separate database with this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weather data provided does not include what time precipitation occurred; it’s possible that on some days, it precipitated during off-peak hours. However, for the purpose of this dashboard, I should assume any amount of precipitation that occurred on the day of the trip could have an impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting bike trips at a location will be impossible if there are no bikes available at a station, so we might need to consider other factors for demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the data must not include any personal info (name, email, phone, address). Personal info is not necessary for this project. Anonymize users to avoid bias. \n",
