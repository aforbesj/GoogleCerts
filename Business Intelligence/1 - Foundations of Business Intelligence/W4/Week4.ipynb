    "\n",
    "In addition to the technical and organizational skills needed to complete end-of-course projects, you will need to practice effective communication skills. To prepare you, each project will require you to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather information about the business problem to be solved or question to be answered\n",

    "\n",
    "### Executive Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Business intelligence professionals need ways to share and communicate plans, updates, and summaries about projects. A common document called an executive summary is used to update decision makers who may not be directly involved in the tasks of a project. In your role as a BI professional, you will often be involved in creating executive summaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, an executive summary can be a useful way to describe your end-of-course project to potential employers. This document can give interviewers exploring your portfolio an easy-to-understand explanation of your projects and be a useful way to reference your projects during the actual interview. \n",
    "\n",
    "The provided sample executive summary deals with an imagined wildfire predictability project. The intended audience of this summary is a group of decision makers from many different departments within teams that service a variety of parks. The purpose of this summary is to share the insights gained through data analysis of wildfires in the US. Each section delivers a short statement without embellishment. This allows decision makers who are often short on time the ability to quickly grasp the most relevant points about a project. Reference this document as you review each of the following sections.\n",

    "- Project title: \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "A statement that focuses on the need or concern being targeted or addressed by the project. Note, also, that the problem can also be referred to as the hypothesis that you’re trying to prove through analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "This statement summarizes a project’s main goal. In this section, actions are described that are intended to address the concerns outlined in the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Details/Key insights: \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is to provide any additional background and information that may assist the target audience in understanding the project's objectives. Determining what details to include depends heavily on the intended audience. It may also be the case that you choose to include some project reflections. \n",
