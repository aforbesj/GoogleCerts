    "### Orgs that benefit from BI\n",
    "\n",
    "BI analysts gather requirements from stakeholders,\n",
    "partners, and team members.\n",
    "They use their understanding of\n",
    "large datasets to retrieve,\n",
    "organize, and interpret data.\n",
    "Then they create visualizations, dashboards,\n",
    "and reports to use when\n",
    "presenting and communicating insights to others.\n",
    "The intelligence they share\n",
    "might be used to make decisions,\n",
    "develop a new process,\n",
    "or create a business strategy,\n",
    "or it could be applied to even deeper analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "BI engineers are responsible for designing,\n",
    "configuring, implementing,\n",
    "and improving data tools and processes.\n",
    "They evaluate and streamline various devices,\n",
    "infrastructures, and\n",
    "information channels called pipelines.\n",
    "Engineers are excellent troubleshooters and\n",
    "help find solutions to security issues,\n",
    "application permissions and updates,\n",
    "and other technical challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a BI engineer\n",
    "manages tools and processes,\n",
    "which enables a BI analyst\n",
    "to put those tools and processes to work.\n",
    "However, it's also important to note\n",
    "that some companies don't distinguish\n",
    "between those two BI jobs, using\n",
    "the terms analyst and engineer interchangeably. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Business intelligence* involves automating processes and information channels in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers. \n",

    "### Ficticious Scenario \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a fictitious scenario about a fast-food restaurant chain. Leaders at this company have huge amounts of data to manage, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    customer transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "    marketing data related to promotions\n",
    "\n",
    "    customer satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "    employee information\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The restaurants need to have ingredients to cook and serve customers, but if they have too much, that extra stock often goes to waste. Company leadership consults with their BI team to consider how to approach two concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    How to ensure the restaurants’ numerous locations have enough ingredients to meet customer demand\n",
    "\n",
    "    How to reduce food waste\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address the stakeholder’s needs, the BI team spends time gathering information about current metrics and processes. They first use this information to determine what data they have and how it’s being used. They discover that there are already useful metrics being applied in other ways by various teams in the company, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    How many ingredients are delivered to each location\n",
    "\n",
    "    How much of each menu item is made each day\n",
    "\n",
    "    How much of each menu item is actually being ordered each day\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing these existing metrics, the company can better understand how much food is going to waste. Thus, the BI analysts are able to gather the necessary information on incoming food delivery, customer orders, and food consumption in the form of a dashboard for stakeholders to monitor food waste. The BI analysts then organize this data within the database systems and deliver it to new tables that report the results for stakeholders to consider as they strategize how to reduce food waste. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The results**\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how much food is actually going to waste now enables stakeholders to better achieve their goals. The restaurant chain discovers that the largest source of food waste is the French fries. Across their locations, 10–20% of French fries are left over at the end of the month."

    "## Phases of BI\n",
    "\n",
    "The data life cycle is a sequence of\n",
    "stages that data experiences,\n",
    "which include plan, capture,\n",
    "manage, analyze, archive, and destroy.\n",
    "The data analysis process occurs in six phases. \n",
    "*Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In BI, the three stages are\n",
    "*capture, analyze, and monitor*.\n",
    "As you advance through each one,\n",
    "the process requires a deeper level of\n",
    "exploration and investigation,\n",
    "so each becomes more complex. The business intelligence phases of capture, analyze, and monitor help determine BI’s business value, as well as an organization’s data maturity level. Data maturity is the extent to which an organization is able to use its data in order to extract actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capture\n",
    "Let's start with capture,\n",
    "which is the \"what happened\" point in the BI process.\n",
    "This stage pertains\n",
    "to static backward-looking data. For instance,\n",
    "if you were to query a database to return a data set\n",
    "about what your customers purchased last month,\n",
    "that's an example of capturing information. Or you\n",
    "might access a spreadsheet that lists\n",
    "profits and losses from the previous quarter.\n",
    "That's also an example of\n",
    "capturing or record of certain information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyze\n",
    "The \"why did it happen\" part of BI.\n",
    "You already know a lot about this stage,\n",
    "but as a quick reminder,\n",
    "data analysis is when we draw conclusions,\n",
    "make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.\n",
    "Because the analyze stage explorers why things happen,\n",
    "it's much more likely to result in\n",
    "effective plans and strategies.\n",
    "In this way, it enables BI professionals to\n",
    "better understand key relationships between data points.\n",
    "They do this by examining data more deeply, more broadly,\n",
    "or even side-by-side, in order to identify\n",
    "connections that at first might not have been apparent. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitor\n",
    "\n",

    "### BI Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Business intelligence strategy is the management of the people,\n",
    "processes, and tools used in the business intelligence process.\n",
    "As you're discovering, BI is complex and\n",
    "it requires a 360 degree view of the organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is everyone coordinated? Are the right questions for vision laid out initially? What is the desired outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "The second element of BI strategy is process.\n",
    "By now, you've established who will be responsible for the rules and\n",
    "policies that govern BI processes.\n",
    "So some questions to ask these people include,\n",
    "what solutions are we using and how?\n",
    "Which of them bring value?\n",
    "What types of solutions do we plan to implement?\n",
    "How will we deliver them?\n",
    "How will we support them?\n",
    "In addition,\n",
    "having a user support framework is a critical part of the process.\n",
    "So be sure to dedicate enough time in training and education,\n",
    "a feedback system, and ensuring users are getting value from the tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important concepts to note here is to choose each tool with\n",
    "the user in mind.\n",
    "Consider which dashboards, reports and other solutions will be most effective.\n",
    "Ask, do different users, teams and departments require different\n",
    "technologies? Which technologies do we have access to?\n",
    "Can we gain access to others if needed?\n",
    "How will we measure success?\n",
    "Here you want to establish key performance indicators or KPIs for\n",
    "each particular business need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KPI\n",
    "\n",
    "KPI is a quantifiable value,\n",
    "closely linked to business strategy, which is used to track progress towards a goal.\n",
    "In other words, KPIs direct you towards achieving your desired results.\n",
    "But in order for KPIs to do their job, it's important that the tools you select\n",
    "align with the KPIs established for each particular project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last step in this process is documenting everything you've learned.\n",
    "Many BI professionals use specific BI documents to note stakeholder\n",
    "requirements, project requirements, and strategy.\n",
    "These are essential tools that can really help you capture the big picture,\n",
    "stay organized, and make an impact at your organization. "

    "\n",
    "### Stakeholder Requirements Doc\n",
    "The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables you to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It should answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business problem: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stakeholders: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stakeholder usage details: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary requirements: What requirements must be met by this BI tool in order for this project to be successful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some questions BI professionals ask in order to successfully complete this document:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What questions must be answered before starting this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What does the BI team need to know before starting this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the questions that must be answered/problems that must be solved by this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What datasets are considered important to this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who should have access to the dashboard? Will the entire dashboard be visible to all stakeholders?\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the Stakeholder Requirements Document is a one-pager with notes, but it can be longer and more detailed for complex projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Requirements Doc\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have established the stakeholder requirements, you can start thinking about the project requirements that need to be met to achieve the stakeholder requirements. The Project Requirements Document contains the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: Briefly describe why this project is happening and explanation of why the company should invest its resources in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key dependencies: Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables. Are there any inter-team deliverables required?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stakeholder requirements: List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Success criteria: Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User journeys: Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumptions: Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compliance and privacy: Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessibility: List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users. Who needs to access this feature? How are they viewing and interacting with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Roll-out plan: Briefly describe the expected scope, priorities and timeline. Consider at what points during the rollout will measurements be made to determine whether the feature is performing as expected? Is there a rollback plan and timeline if this feature does not meet its intended goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, some companies will ask you to include a list of references. If so, it’s a best practice to be liberal in citing references; you can never have too many. References might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documents or websites you read and researched while working on this project\n",
    "\n",
    "- Laws and policies: Any regulations driving the project requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project tracking: A link to tracking spreadsheet, bug hotlist, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar projects: A description of anything similar that has been attempted in the past or any parallel efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Stakeholder Requirements Document, the Project Requirements Document will vary depending on the complexity of the project. It might just be an email sent out to stakeholders to keep them updated on expectations and check-in points, or it could be a multi-page document with a spreadsheet that outlines the project plan and key tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy Doc\n",
    "Finally, you will create a Strategy Document for your project. This is the final phase of the planning process. The Strategy Document is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables. You will work together to establish information about dashboard functionality and associated metrics and charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a time to flesh out what metrics will be required, how metrics are calculated, and any limitations or assumptions that exist about the data. Stakeholders think through these details and help the BI professional make final project decisions. Then, the BI professional provides stakeholders with a dashboard mockup to get valuable feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the BI professional will create the document and request review and sign-off from important stakeholders. Then they can begin working on the project with all of the details they need."

Because you will want to continue making improvements to the system, you need to create ways to test any changes before they’re implemented to avoid disrupting users’ access to the data.
