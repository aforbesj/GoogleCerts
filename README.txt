This is a REPO where I will be studying and implementing what I learn in The Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate and the
Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate

Both Certificates are useful for Data Analytics so I will acquire both. I want to upload and commit to Github even more, so I will experiment taking notes
in Jupyter Notebook both with Markdown and in Python if able.
